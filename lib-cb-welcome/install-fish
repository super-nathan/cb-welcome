  INSTALL FISH
  -------------------
  FISH (The Friendly Interactive Shell) is an easy to use, color, coded 
  shell for the command line. It also has easy to use auto completion. If
  you are not a heavy shell user and want to make it easier and more 
  intuitive fish is for you. NOTE: some bash commands are not compatible 
  with fish, you would need to enter bash by typing (bash).
  If you want, the following packages will be installed:

      fish

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies may also be installed.

  INSTALL NGINX SERVER
  ------------------
  Would you like to install the very fast and very lightwight Nginx webserver? If you only
   have static (like html) webpages, Nginx will be much faster and use less resources than 
   Apache2. If you choose to do this, the following packages will be installed:

      nginx apache2-utils

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies may also be installed.

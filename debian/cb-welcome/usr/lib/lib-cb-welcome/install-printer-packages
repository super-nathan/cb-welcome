  PRINTER SUPPORT
  ---------------
  By default, PiBang does not come with printer support. Would you like
  to add printer support now? If you choose to do this, the following packages
  will be installed:

      cups cups-pdf system-config-printer printer-driver-hpijs

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies may also be installed.
